# 17 CS | Regex Tutorial

## The Challenge: 

Your assignment this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your walkthrough.

## Project Conduction:

As a web development student, I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex, then I can have a better understanding about the search pattern that regex defines.


## Acceptance Criteria:

- Given a regex tutorial, when the user opens the tutorial
they see the following:
    - descriptive title
    - introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial
    - a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial
    - a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does
    - a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile

- When the user clicks on the links in the table of contents, they are taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial.

- When the user reads through each section of the tutorial, they find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does.

- When the user reaches the end of the tutorial, they find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile.


#### Short List

* Include all of the sections that correspond to the different components of the regex you chose.

* Each section that describes a component must include more than just one sentence explaining what it does, be thourogh.

* Each section that describes a component must include a code snippet of that particular component. Use backticks to display your code snippets in Markdown.

* Each section that describes a component must include at least one example that meets the requirements of that component.
